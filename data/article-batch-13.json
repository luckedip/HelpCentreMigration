Many organisations will have reduced or free memberships for students. This often allows you to access industry-specific careers advice, find lists of registered professionals, and sometimes, attend events or training. If you are able, joining in with any of these events can be a great way to continue to build your networks.  ",

So early on in the application process you can let us know if you want to. There's no pressure to. If you feel like it’s not going to influence anything and it’s not - you don’t need any extra time or any adjustments at all then obviously it’s up to you completely if you want to disclose that to us. But if you do feel like actually by getting perhaps extra time to do the online test or maybe extra time during one of the assessment activities if it’s going to be beneficial then do. Just let us know. We will always keep it confidential within our recruitment team. But I would say that’s very – very helpful and even later in the process if you maybe didn’t want to tell us immediately um when you applied but actually perhaps your assessment centre or your interview is coming closer and you think it would be beneficial to let us know then do. When you are in our process you will have a contact point so you can always get in touch with them at any point and let us know and we will do our best to make sure that we give you extra time or whatever it might be that you need from us.",

Please could you make adjustments in your marking?’ And that’s simply not possible at that point in time. It’s unfair to all of the other candidates in the process. If we’d known up front we could have made those adjustments and we could have dealt with everybody fairly. So the key for me is disclose and disclose early.

Sometimes, people find recording examples which show you have the skills and experience they want, is a very helpful way, because then you have an audio record of your examples. You can use this to write down headings on a piece of paper, which you can take with you into the interview. You’ll need to take paper into the interview with you anyway, most people do this, and because it’s always a good idea to write down the questions you may want to ask them at the end of the interview. Or you can use a small notebook or postcards. So we have covered whether to tell an employer, how to tell an employer and aspects of the job seeking process. Now, I am going to ask a very obvious question but I have a reason for asking it. If someone asked you to explain what dyslexia is, could you do this?",
