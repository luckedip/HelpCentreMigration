And, of course, it was no surprise that this essay was plastered in comments. All good feedback, I mean, it's all feedback, it's all comments that are designed to help you. But at the end of it my tutor wrote that \"Mick, you obviously know your subject matter rather well. However, with all due respect, you do tend to go at it like a brim and firestone preacher thundering from the pulpit\". And, of course, I can understand that now. But, at the time, I didn't see it that way. I thought well, \"What's wrong with my essay? I thought it was brilliant. How dare you criticise me\". And, of course, now I can look back and read the essay and agree with her. But, at the time, I didn't see it that way. At the time I thought \"How dare she criticise me? This is my magnum opus and, I would not be challenged this way\".",

And, after a while I would look back at the comments and say, \"Hmm, OK. Yeah, I can see what you mean. Yeah, you've got a point there\". And what I did subsequently was try and hone that in, that feedback, into my next few assignments, and be a little bit less subjective and a bit more objective, and avoid the sweeping statements and the journalistic lingo and things. And that was a big help. But I still had a few weaknesses. Some of my writing could still be a little bit too subjective. And sometimes I would neglect to contrast other arguments from other academic writers.",

And, again I had to go through a process of learning where I'd get lots of feedback from my OU tutor, particularly in my first year, and to a certain degree my second year, where you'd have to justify everything you'd written, and back it up with evidence, not just with evidence from other writers and contrasting them, 'cos that's what you do at first degree level ... at postgraduate level you have to use more evidence, more primary evidence to back up what you're saying.

Why all these comments? Oh I must be really stupid\". It's nothing to do with that. Your tutor's not there to undermine your confidence. He or she are not there to make you look stupid. They're there to help you. And they're there to try and help you improve your academic skills. So really, ultimately what you need to be doing is taking note of your tutor, and have a talk with your tutor. That's what they're there for. You can have a talk to them too, discuss issues further and basically absorb what they're trying to say. And then, try and incorporate what you've learnt into your next assignment, and so on and so forth. And you go through a process of learning.
