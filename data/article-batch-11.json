Now, if you look at what you’ve studied, it’s probably going to be in four categories, there’s going to be stuff that I’m going to call ‘type A’ which is stuff that you know you can do, you don’t really need to worry about it. Now, a lot of people spend too much time revising ‘type A’ stuff, because it’s comforting, it’s nice, it’s a comfort blanket, no, don’t do that, if you already know it then you don’t need to learn it. Then there’s ‘type B’ stuff, and type b is things where you understood it at the time but maybe you don’t remember it so well. You need to revise this folks because, if you didn’t remember it at the time you need to remember it for the exam. Then there’s ‘type C’ and type C is when it starts getting a little bit uncomfortable, and that’s things that maybe you didn’t get so well but you know it’s really really important, maybe your tutor has reminded you it’s important, maybe you’ve seen it comes up in past exam questions, now type C you really need to focus on, and get it in early because if you’re still stuck on it you need time to ask your tutor and talk to your fellow students about it. And then there’s type D, type D is these horrible little niggly bits that always you can’t quite get your head round, but, they don’t come up that much, maybe they’ve come up once in five years, forget type D, these stupid little niggles, they’re not that important, don’t worry about them.",

Now let’s think about how you revise, now there are many bits of advice about how to revise as there are people, but there are few key things that proper actual serious academic research, you know, the sort of thing you’d have to give a reference for, actually shows applies for everybody. And the first one is, if you want to remember stuff, you actually get better at remembering by trying to remember – who knew? It’s like practicing everything else. So, you need to, during your revision, try remembering things, test yourself. The second one is, it doesn’t work to learn all of something all at once, and then never come back to it again. What you need to do is to keep revisiting it, so, do a little bit of your first topic then onto your second topic and then on to your third topic and then maybe next week, come back to the first topic again. You can’t just do it all and then not do anything before the exam because it just won’t stay in your brain. And the third one is being active, hardly anyone can revise by just actually sitting there and reading because you start staring through the pages don’t you, you know you start thinking what your dinner is, what holiday you’re going to book, how cute your cat looks or your dog if you’re a dog person, erm, you don’t concentrate so you need to be active. Now let’s think about what you could do to be active. Well, a lot of people find making their own summaries is good, now if you’re me, I’m not one of these creative people, I just do bullet points, but lots of people do nice things like mind maps, so give it a go, see which of those works. Quite a few people find actually that if they record themselves and listen to themselves that helps, and also explaining it to someone else, if you haven’t actually got family members who’ll agree, explain it to your cat or the dog, they won’t usually object, and think how much those study buddies have helped you during the year, I’m sure they’d love to help you with your revision as well. So, make sure you’re doing those sorts of things.",

If anything, under estimate, then you’ve got a little bit of leeway haven’t you. And also, make sure you take some breaks, not enough breaks that you can then go and play a family game of Monopoly, or you’re going to go for a 10 mile hike, but enough time to maybe just go down the corner shop, make yourself a cup of tea, those sorts of things, and take a break when your brain is switching off, if you’re staring at the page and you’re thinking “I’ve no idea what this is about”, take a break. And variety, who on Earth can actually do the same thing for that long and stay focussed? So, think about doing things like preparing those summaries, testing yourself, doing past paper questions, revisiting TMAs, maybe listening to tutorial recordings, there’s all sorts of different things you can do, build in that variety to stop yourself just switching off.",

And one of the reasons they’re important is because actually taking the exam is a skill in itself. You wouldn’t go into your driving test and think “Oh well, I’ll just go into my driving test and I won’t practice the manoeuvres”, same way, you don’t go into an exam without practicing actually doing the taking the exam. So to do that, you need to get your past paper, you need to sit yourself down in proper exam conditions, no sneaky peeks at the book, no sneaky wanders out to the shop or playing games or anything like that, three hours, sat there, no books, at your table, write your answers out in full, don’t just think “Oh I know that bit I won’t write the rest of it”, write it all, otherwise your timing’s just going to go a bit wonky isn’t it. So, do those practice papers. Me, I’d always do at least three at a time, you may not feel you’ve got that much time but that’s what I do. When you’ve done them, go back to them, this time with your notes, and see, OK, did I get everything in I should do? Are there things you keep forgetting? If there’s stuff you keep forgetting, make a note of it so you can adjust your revision accordingly.",

Now, your exam’s going to be in a morning or an afternoon, now, I know that’s a bummer if you’re not an afternoon person or you’re not a morning person, but it does help, if you know your exam’s in the afternoon, get in the habit of doing a bit of academic work in the afternoon. There’s no point trying to convince your body that it wants to do an exam in the afternoon if you’re used to just having a bit of a snooze then is there? So get in that habit and keep yourself fresh. Once when I was a very young and silly 20 year old, I turned up to an exam having done lots of last-minute ‘cramming’ and I was fuelled up with glucose tablets and Pro-plus, nothing illegal note, it was all perfectly legal but I was fuelled up with that, and I was so jittery, I could not think straight, and guess what, that’s the one exam in my life I really made a mess of. So make sure you’re fresh, make sure your sleep cycle ties in with the exam. And I’m going to finish off again by saying what I said at the beginning, don’t panic, they want you to do well, they want to give you the marks. And finally, if something does go wrong, maybe things were a bit difficult coming up with health-wise, or family matters up to the exam, don’t forget you can fill in special circs, that can make a difference.",

It covers things like TMAs, iCMAs, exams, emTMAs and EMAs. </p>\n    <h2>Assessment banking</h2>\n    <p>If you've arranged a deferral and your module is eligible, it may be possible for you to keep the scores from assessments you've already completed and carry these forward to a future presentation of the same module. You won't be able to go back and submit any assignments you missed out. Bear in mind assessment banking isn't available on all modules, and must be discussed with your student support team first, to explore if it's a good option for you. </p>\n    <h2>Assessment strategy</h2>\n    <p>A detailed breakdown of the way a module is assessed (such as the learning outcomes to be met, type and number of assessments and their weighting). Information about this can be found on your module record on StudentHome. There may also be information in the module guide, assignment booklets or module materials. </p>\n    <h2>Assignments</h2>\n    <p>Assignments is the term we use for the parts of the module assessment that aren't the final assessed task - for example, TMAs, iCMAs and reports. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lC\">\n    <h2>Capped</h2>\n    <p>Resits and resubmissions are normally capped at the lowest grade of pass. This means your module result following a resit or resubmission won't be higher than a bare Pass or Pass 4 grade. </p>\n    <h2>Cluster Examination and Assessment Board (Cluster EAB)</h2>\n    <p>The Cluster EAB will confirm the standards of the module result process and recommend a result for each student in the cluster within a conflation period. Cluster EABs will include one or more External Examiner. </p>\n    <h2>Component of assessment</h2>\n    <p>This term refers to means your overall continuous assessment score (OCAS), your overall examinable component score (OES) or your overall assessment score (OAS). More generally, it's a set of assessed tasks on which the Module Result Panel sets overall thresholds for each grade of pass when determining module results. </p>\n    <!--<h2>Computer-marked assignment (CMA)</h2>\n\n<dd>\n<p>Paper-based assignments used for teaching and assessment purposes. The questions are always multiple-choice and students complete a computer-readable form. This type of assignment is submitted by post directly to the Assessment Processing Centre at the University. Computer-generated score and feedback letters are despatched by post a few days after the cut-off date. Also see eCMAs and iCMAs. </p>\n</dd> -->\n    <h2>Continuous assessment</h2>\n    <p>The name given to the set of assignments (TMAs and iCMAs) that you complete during a module. Information about these can be found in the module guide, assignment booklets or module materials. See also summative assessment and formative assessment. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lD\">\n    <h2>Deferral</h2>\n    <p>Stopping a module part way through with the aim of returning to finish it later. See also assessment banking. </p>\n    <h2>Discretionary postponement</h2>\n    <p>If you can't complete your exam, EMA or emTMA, the University may give you permission to postpone it to the next available opportunity. You'll need to provide third party evidence of serious and unexpected circumstances outside your control, which prevent you from sitting your exam or submitting your work at the scheduled time. Strict criteria and deadlines apply. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lE\">\n    <h2>Elective postponement</h2>\n    <p>If you're offered a resit or resubmission within 12-16 weeks of your original exam or EMA/emTMA submission, you may be able to postpone the resit/resubmission to the next available opportunity. You should note this could be up to 9 months later.</p>\n    <h2>End-of-module assessment (EMA)</h2>\n    <p>On many modules, you have to work independently to produce an extended piece of work rather than sitting a traditional exam at the end of your study. For ease of reference, these essays, projects, portfolios, dissertations, assessments, etc. are referred to collectively as end-of-module assessments (EMAs). EMAs can take many forms, ranging from a very short piece of text written in a foreign language, through project reports of a few thousand words in length, to files of evidence summarising your achievements during the module, up to a 50,000-word dissertation. A word limit and a strictly-policed submission deadline apply to EMAs, so you need to develop skills in time and content management.</p>\n    <p>On the majority of modules, EMAs have to be submitted electronically.</p>\n    <p>Extensions aren't allowed for EMAs under <strong>any</strong> circumstances.</p>\n    <p>Very occasionally, a module may have both an EMA and an exam. </p>\n    <p>More information can be found in the <a href='https://help.open.ac.uk/students/_data/documents/assessment/ema-emtma-guidelines.pdf'>EMA and emTMA guidelines</a> booklet (PDF, 228 KB). </p>\n\n    <h2>End-of-module tutor-marked assignment (emTMA)</h2>\n    <p>The final TMA on modules with no exam or EMA. </p>\n    <h2>Equally weighted</h2>\n    <p>Module assessment strategies with two components, such as Overall Examinable Score (OES) and Overall Continuous Assessment Score (OCAS), often refer to the two components as being equally weighted. This means they have the same value when the rank score is calculated in the module. However, you must reach the thresholds on the OES, the OCAS and rank separately to pass the module or achieve each grade of pass, irrespective of the weighting.</p>\n    <h2>ET3</h2>\n    <p>The cover sheet that accompanies each copy of the end-of-module assessment (EMA) if you have to submit your work on paper. </p>\n    <h2>eTMA/eEMA system</h2>\n    <p>The University's system that allows you to submit work electronically for assessment. </p>\n    <h2>Examinable component</h2>\n    <p>The name given to one or more tasks on modules with two components of assessment. It's usually undertaken at the end of a module and is marked by someone other than your tutor. For most modules with an examinable component, this is made up of an exam or end-of-module assessment (EMA), but it can include other items of examinable work. More information can be found in the module materials. Very occasionally a module may have both an exam and an EMA. </p>\n    <h2>Exams</h2>\n    <p>The University holds a number of different types of exam in exam periods at the end of module presentations. Exams will be online and taken remotely. The duration and format of exams varies by module.</p>\n    <h2>External Examiner</h2>\n    <p>External Examiners form an important part of the University's quality assurance processes. They ensure results are determined fairly and advise the University on comparability with other Higher Education institutions. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lF\">\n    <h2><a name=\"fail\"></a>Fail</h2>\n    <p>The required standard hasn't been achieved for a pass result to be awarded. The <a href=\"https://help.open.ac.uk/documents/policies/module-results-determination-policy\">Module Results Determination Policy</a> contains more information about module result statuses. </p>\n    <h2>Formative assignment</h2>\n    <p> In contrast to a summative assignment, a formative assignment doesn't normally count towards the overall module result. It's used on some modules for teaching purposes only but it's important to note it could still be compulsory and you might not pass a module if you don't submit it. Check your assessment strategy (via the Assessment section on <a href=\"https://msds.open.ac.uk/students/\">StudentHome</a>) to find out more. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lI\">\n    <h2>Interactive computer-marked assignment (iCMA)</h2>\n    <p> An interactive computer-marked assignment submitted online which can incorporate short answers or drag and drop answers as well as the traditional multiple choice questions. Some iCMAs give more than one chance at a question, and some offer immediate feedback on the answer. </p>\n   \n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lM\">\n    <h2>Module Result Panel (MRP)</h2>\n    <p>The Module Result Panel (MRP) is responsible for the setting and marking of all controlled\n        assessments for each presentation of a specific module, and for proposing a result for each\n        student on a module presentation to the Cluster Examination and Assessment Board (Cluster EAB). </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lO\">\n    <h2>Overall assessment score (OAS)</h2>\n    <p>All the assessment for your module will be in either Overall Continuous Assessment Score (OCAS) or Overall Examinable Score (OES). There will only be one component and your assessment strategy (via the Assessment section on <a href=\"https://msds.open.ac.uk/students/\">StudentHome</a>) will explain what you must do to pass the module. </p>\n    <h2><a name=\"ocas\"></a>Overall continuous assessment score (OCAS)</h2>\n    <p>This is a score out of 100 which has been achieved for continuous assessment on the module. Continuous assessment is usually made up of assignments such as tutor marked assignments (TMAs) and interactive computer marked assessments (iCMAs). Your assessment strategy (via the Assessment section on <a href=\"https://msds.open.ac.uk/students/\">StudentHome</a>) will explain how much each individual assignment contributes towards OCAS. </p>\n    <h2><a name=\"oes\"></a>Overall examinable component score (OES)</h2>\n    <p>This is a score out of 100 which has been achieved for the examinable component on modules with two separate components of assessment. The examinable component is usually an exam or an end-of-module assessment (EMA) such as a project, poster, speaking assessment (language modules) or dissertation. It may also be a combination of these types of assessment. Very occasionally, a module may have both an EMA and an exam. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lP\">\n    <h2><a name=\"pass\"></a>Pass</h2>\n    <p>The required standard has been achieved by the student. The <a href=\"https://help.open.ac.uk/documents/policies/module-results-determination-policy\">Module Results Determination Policy</a> contains more information about module result statuses. </p>\n    <h2>Poster presentation</h2>\n    <p>Poster presentations are used mainly on science modules. You'll need to produce a poster that conveys your understanding of a particular topic. The poster format imposes strict restrictions on page size and word count. It therefore requires you to demonstrate your skills in summarising and presenting information. This allows 'communication skills' features such as layout and appropriate use of text and pictorial information to be assessed at the same time as the academic content of your poster. </p>\n    <h2>PT3</h2>\n    <p>The form used by your tutor to record their marks and comments for a TMA or emTMA. For modules where you submit your TMA on paper, this form is used as a cover sheet. A blank form is enclosed with the module materials and a new form will be sent to you with each returned TMA. You'll get a copy of the completed PT3 for each marked TMA. For eTMAs, the system automatically generates an electronic PT3 when each TMA is returned to you. Note the PT3 for an emTMA isn't available until your module result is released. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lR\">\n    <h2>Rank score</h2>\n    <p>For modules with more than one component of assessment, the rank score is the weighted average of the Overall Examinable Score (OES) and Overall Continuous Assessment Score (OCAS) components. </p>\n    <h2>Resit</h2>\n    <p>If you take your exam but don't achieve the required standard for a pass on your module, you may be offered a resit opportunity. There is a minimum requirement to qualify for a resit specific to your module/s, which is explained in the Assessment section on <a href=\"https://msds.open.ac.uk/students/\">StudentHome</a>. You can only resit once and your module result will normally be capped. </p>\n    <h2>Resubmission</h2>\n    <p>If you submit your end-of-module assessment (EMA) or end-of-module tutor-marked assignment (emTMA) but don't achieve the required standard for a pass on your module, you may be offered a resubmission opportunity. There is a minimum requirement to qualify for a resubmission specific to your module/s, which is explained in the Assessment section on <a href=\"https://msds.open.ac.uk/students/\">StudentHome</a>. You may only resubmit once, and your module result will normally be capped. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lS\">\n    <h2>Speaking assessments</h2>\n    <p>Speaking assessments are normally used on language modules to assess your speaking and listening skills.</p>\n    <h2>Special circumstances</h2>\n    <p>If your performance in any of the assessment on your module has been affected by something beyond your control, you can bring these 'special circumstances' to the attention of the Module Result Panel for consideration when they agree your module result. Please see <a href=\"/special-circumstances-exams-or-emas\">Special Circumstances - exams, EMAs or emTMAs</a> for details of the criteria and deadlines that apply. </p>\n    <h2>Substitution score</h2>\n    <p>If a module permits substitution, it's applied at the end of the module but only if it will improve your OCAS score. Substitution is explained in <a href=\"/what-is-substitution\">What is substitution?</a>. </p>\n    <h2>Summative assignment</h2>\n    <p> An assignment that counts towards the overall module result. See also formative assignment. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lT\">\n    <h2>Threshold</h2>\n    <p>On some modules there's a minimum requirement or score (such as 40%) that you must achieve for an individual piece of work or activity, or for a number of pieces of work combined, in order to achieve a pass result. Information about this can be found in your assessment strategy (via the Assessment section on <a href=\"https://msds.open.ac.uk/students/\">StudentHome</a>). </p>\n    <h2>Tutor-marked assignment (TMA)</h2>\n    <p> As part of the teaching methodology on most modules, you have to submit written assignments to your tutor. These are called tutor-marked assignments. For most modules you have to submit your assignments electronically using the University's online eTMA (electronic tutor-marked assignment) system. Tutors access the assignment, mark it online and upload it back to the system. The system records the score and automatically makes the marked assignment available to you. Some modules can't use eTMAs due to the type of work, so they're submitted on paper. In these cases your tutor marks the assignment, giving a score and written comments on the PT3 form, and sends it to the University by post for the score to be recorded. The assignment and a copy of the PT3 form are then returned to you by post. See also PT3 and emTMA. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lV\">\n    <h2>Viva voce</h2>\n    <p>Where a Module Result Panel (MRP) decides it would like to obtain more evidence before agreeing your module result, it may offer you a viva voce assessment. The MRP decides on the format of that assessment - it may be written, spoken or both. We'll tell you that you're being offered a viva voce at or before the module result release date. A separate communication will be sent about the format of the viva voce and when it will be held. The module result is held pending the outcome of the viva voce.</p>\n    <p> Viva voce assessments aren't available to students on request.</p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>\n<div id=\"lW\">\n    <h2>Weighted average</h2>\n    <p>For modules with only one component of assessment, not all tasks are equally weighted when determining module results. Overall scores are determined by a weighted average. This is the calculation of a student’s overall assessment score (OAS) from an average resulting from the multiplication of each score by its weighting. Your assessment strategy (via the Assessment section on <a href=\"https://msds.open.ac.uk/students/\">StudentHome</a>) will tell you the weighting for each assessed task. </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#int-content\" class=\"back-to-top\">Back to top</a>",
