There are some graduate recruiters who ask for A level grades or UCAS points as a requirement. For some it’s about prestige: they ask for three As or 360 points, plus a 1st or 2:1, so that they can say they employ ‘the very best people’. For other employers it is a way to reduce the very high number of applications they receive. There can be many reasons why employers ask for A levels, but this can cause problems for OU students who are already working and studying, and may not have the time or the willingness to take on A levels at this stage of their life.",
