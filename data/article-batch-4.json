Turning a negative into a positive with input from our employer engagement team and from people who've been there, done that and survived. In our final podcast in this series we'll explore searching for work and ways to increase your skill set. Today's podcast focuses on preparing for redundancy and acknowledging its impact.

If you're at risk, then there's ways you can protect yourself by planning ahead. If you know you're going to be made redundant you may be entitled to time off work for interviews. Some firms may also help you finding a new job or perhaps a helpline to talk to someone about redundancy or other personal issues. I would strongly recommend investigating what options available to you provided by your employer as early as possible when learning you've been made redundant. Alex have you heard of ACAS? For any of our listeners who don't know, ACAS offer employees and employers free impartial advice on workplace rights, rules and best practice.",

If you're worried about money it can make your mental health worse and it makes managing finances difficult in many ways is a vicious cycle.

The mental health charity Mind produced a step by step guide to support managing redundancy and taking care of your mental health, details of which will be on our web page. Let's take time now to explore this resource in a bit more depth. So do take stock of how you're feeling, as you've seen it's perfectly natural to feel a range of emotions. It's important to provide space for these feelings. If you have social support do use it. Express your feelings and let others know how redundancy might be impacting on you.",

So, when that's taken from us it can actually have a big impact on our self-esteem. I would say try to be kind to yourself if you're in this position because it is a difficult time. Do things that make you happy too amongst all that job seeking and don't punish yourself. Remember it's your job that's been made redundant not you. It's also a time to perhaps reflect and take stock of what gives you happiness and fulfilment, perhaps writing a list of all the skills and qualities you have and take a moment to celebrate them.

Don't be afraid of starting a little bit lower down the ladder if you're going to change direction because your previous experience will, the, the transferable skills that you bring from all your previous experience will definitely be useful in another role and will probably make you progress much more quickly. And the third one is, understand your transferable skills. Really look at yourself and look at it and say, \"oh, I've achieved this, I've achieved that, I can do this and I can do that\" and see, \"OK, I can if I can apply it here, what else could I apply it to?\" Those are my three tips, I think.

Allow yourself to feel vulnerable rather than being only upbeat and sort of jolly-hockey-sticks all the time and repressing those negative feelings. What we found helpful was using anger as a resource for energy to undertake the job seeking process at this, we found especially useful if unemployment lasts longer than you expect. And finally, and really importantly, I can't emphasise this one enough. Don't forget to have fun and do other things rather than just searching for work whilst under the threat of redundancy or unemployed. That's because you need to reward yourself finding job vacancies, preparing CVs, preparing for interviews. It's hard work and you need to give yourself those little rewards, keep yourself going and recognise the effort you're putting into it. So, look after your mental and physical health as well as the job seeking process, because looking for a job can be very draining.",

They also said understanding that they have skills that are actually transferable should give the individual an increase in confidence. Another employer that we spoke to said that job searching was the minimum that should be done once being made redundant. They stressed that you should try and avoid gaps in your CV as they can make you look less appealing to an employer. The recruiter suggested that there are things that can be done to fill in these gaps. So, things like completing extra study, online training, work experience or volunteering. Another important point that they made was making sure that your online profile on platforms such as LinkedIn are kept up to date because online networking can be a really useful way of finding new opportunities and gaining insights into the industry.",

The introduction to the house and what different rooms you're about to see, that would be the introductory paragraph. Then you move into the living room and say, 'This is the living room' which is your introductory sentence, and then you describe what's in the living room, that's the rest of the paragraph. Then you move into the next room which is the next paragraph, introduce that, give the detail and then move on like that. And that seems to help students organise things.",
